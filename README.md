# How to use the code?
We have shared Chaskey's software-based masking source code, which can be traced by the tool ELMO(https://github.com/sca-research/ELMO). To facilitate running directly on ELMO, we have shared the complete script (chaskey.py). The running parameters can be customized.
If you want to try other ARX algorithms, you can directly refer to the functions of AM, BM and conversion between AM and BM in chaskeyMasking.c.
