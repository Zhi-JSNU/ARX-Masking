# How to use the code?
We have shared Chaskey's software-based masking source code, which can be traced by the tool ELMO. To facilitate running directly on ELMO, we have shared the complete script (chaskey.py). The running parameters can be customized.
If you want to try other ARX algorithms, you can directly refer to the functions of AM, BM and conversion between AM and BM in chaskeyMasking.c.
# What is ELMO?
ELMO (https://github.com/sca-research/ELMO) consists of two components: an emulator for the ARM M0 architecture and a set of leakage models. The emulator takes in Thumb assembly and 'emulates' the workings of an M0 core (in particular the 3 stage pipeline). The power models utilise the instruction flow generated by the emulator to produce cycle or instruction accurate predictions of the power consumption (noise free). ELMO in its' base version emulates the power consumption of many instructions but limited to the contribution of the CPU core only. There is a simple 'memory extension', which gives a very basic model of the power consumption of the memory bus.
